# Vulnerability Scanner
This python script crawls through all files in a directory and finds vulnerabilities as per the OWASP Top 10 and others that were previously on the Top 10 by using regex functions for each vulnerability.

The program has been updated to included a simple GUI that allows for directory selection and a result window. 

Program updated to add the ability to send the output result to a file for easier log management.
